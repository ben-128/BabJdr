# Build Output

This folder contains the latest standalone HTML bundle produced by `npm run build`.

- `JdrBab.html` is generated by `scripts/build-simple.js`. It inlines all CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data so the app runs offline without a web server.
- Do not edit files here manually; regenerate them by running the build again.
- The GitHub Pages deployment serves the file from `build-output/`, so keep this directory under version control.

To validate a fresh build, open the file directly in a browser, then run `npm run pwa-test` if you need to inspect service-worker behaviour over HTTPS.
